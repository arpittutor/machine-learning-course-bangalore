The most exciting branch of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning is all around us in this modern era. As Facebook suggesting the stories in your feed, same Machine Learning brings out the power of data in a new way. It works on the phenomemnon of working on the development of computer programs that can access data and perform tasks automatically through predictions and detections, Machine Learning enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience continuously. Intellipaat is offering an industry-specific one of the Best Machine Learning Courses in Bangalore which mainly focuses on key modules such as Python, Algorithms, Statistics & Probability, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear & Logistic regression, etc.

What is Machine Learning

If talikng about Machine Learning definition then, it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process. While the concept of Machine Learning has been around for a very long time (think of the WWII Enigma Machine), the ability to automate the application of complex mathematical calculations to Big Data has been gaining momentum over the past several years. At a high level, ML is the ability to adapt to new data independently and through iterations.  Basically, applications learn from previous computations and transactions and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable and informed results.
